# UD_repronim

"[ReproNim's](https://www.repronim.org/) goal is to improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging science and extend the value of our national investment in neuroimaging research, while making the process easier and more efficient for investigators."

Towards this goal, the [ReproNim Fellowship Program](https://www.repronim.org/fellowship.html) supports individual syllabus development and implementation of reproducibility training at appointed fellows' home institutions. 

The current workshop series, UD ReproNim, is a product of this ReproNim Fellowship Program, and as such, draws heavily from existing open-source materials in the neuroimaging community to foster growth and knowledge of existing, reproducible computational technologies, pipelines/workflows, data wrangling approaches and statistical toolboxes. 

The Fellows who organized this workshop, Drs. Jennifer Legault and [Julie Schneider](https://sites.udel.edu/jmschneider/), thank those who have come before them to establish and share the resources included in the current repo. 

## Resources

## Requirements

This workshop will rely heavily on the use of Terminal -- therefore, working knowledge of how to use a Shell is necessary. You don't need to be a professional, but being able to cd in and out of directories with confidence will benefit you greatly! To help you get started, we have provided some resources for [Bash/Shell scripting](https://github.com/juliagoolia28/UD_repronim/tree/master/bash_unix_resources).

You will also need to have some things installed prior to our first workshop:
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/)

If you are using lab data, working on a lab server, or setting up these pipelines for your lab computers:
- Be able to [VPN](https://udeploy.udel.edu/software/anyconnect-vpn/) onto the UD network
- Need to have setup [Google Authentication](https://services.udel.edu/TDClient/32/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=4) to VPN/Remotely connect to lab computers
