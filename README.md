# UD_repronim

"[ReproNim's](https://www.repronim.org/) goal is to improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging science and extend the value of our national investment in neuroimaging research, while making the process easier and more efficient for investigators."

Towards this goal, the [ReproNim Fellowship Program](https://www.repronim.org/fellowship.html) supports individual syllabus development and implementation of reproducibility training at appointed fellows' home institutions. 

The current workshop series, UD ReproNim, is a product of this ReproNim Fellowship Program, and as such, draws heavily from existing open-source materials in the neuroimaging community to foster growth and knowledge of existing, reproducible computational technologies, pipelines/workflows, data wrangling approaches and statistical toolboxes. 

The Fellows who organized this workshop, Drs. Jennifer Legault and [Julie Schneider](https://sites.udel.edu/jmschneider/), thank those who have come before them to establish and share the resources included in the current repo.
