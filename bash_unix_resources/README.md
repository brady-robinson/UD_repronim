# Bash/Unix Tutorial

## Resources:
[Software Carpentry tutorial: Software Carpentry Unix Tutorial](http://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/shell-novice/ )

Completely new to Terminal? Maybe even a little afraid of the "black box"? I recommend [this Medium resource](https://medium.com/@grace.m.nolan/terminal-for-beginners-e492ba10902a) as a starting off point. It breaks down the most important commands you will need to know for executing any future analyses.

## Requirements:

- These tutorials are geared towards Mac/Linux users. 
- If you use a PC, we recommend installing and using [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)
